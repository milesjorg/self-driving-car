                    Make sure to fill out all fields and click "Save inputs" before clicking "Run".
                    Try adjusting different inputs to see how the car behaves differently (especially
                    number of rays, ray length, and mutation value). It may take many runs before you
                    start to see the kind of behavior you want, but once you do, make sure to save the
                    brain! Keep mutating to get a smarter car, then try upping the speed!
